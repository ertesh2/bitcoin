This is a training Windows Phone app.
The idea is to get live bitcoin price feed periodically in background process and display it on the windows tile.
I'd like to experiment with push notifications as well, maybe some price visualisation or Azure service.
The aim is to use decent style, unit testing and possibly TDD.
